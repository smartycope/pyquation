# pyquation

A library to handle math equations like Python classes
I built this while taking various college classes. There's a 4 modules currently preloaded with a bunch of equations available: mathEquations, physicsEquations, waveEquations, and electronicsEquations. Some of them are accurate, some of them may not be, and some of them are my mad flailings as I try to understand the subject matter in real time. Use at your own risk.
The Equation, Unit, and Namespace classes should work just fine, however.
